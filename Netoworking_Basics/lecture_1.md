## A Structure View

Different ISPs talk to each other via IXPs

    - IXP: Internet exchange point
    - Peering Link: Direct ISP to ISP connection
        - No money changes hands, only traffic

    -CDNs: Content delivery network
        -Why? CDNs are global netoworks that are meant to increase download/content speeds
        -Private CDN: doesn't host others traffic
